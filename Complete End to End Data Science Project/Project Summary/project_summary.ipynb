    "\n",
    "INX Future Inc , (referred as INX ) , is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider\n",
    "with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as top 20 best employers past 5\n",
    "years. INX human resource policies are considered as employee friendly and widely perceived as best\n",
    "practices in the industry.\n",
    "Recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing\n",
    "concerns among the top management. There has been increased escalations on service delivery and\n",
    "client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points.\n",
    "CEO, Mr. Brain, knows the issues but concerned to take any actions in penalizing non-performing\n",
    "employees as this would affect the employee morale of all the employees in general and may further\n",
    "reduce the performance. Also, the market perception best employer and thereby attracting best talents\n",
    "to join the company.\n",
    "Mr. Brain decided to initiate a data science project , which analyses the current employee data and find\n",
    "the core underlying causes of this performance issues. Mr. Brain, being a data scientist himself, expects\n",
    "the findings of this project will help him to take right course of actions. He also expects a clear indicators\n",
    "of non performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may\n",
    "not significantly affect other employee morals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Goal and Insights of the project are as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Department wise performances\n",
    "* Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance\n",
    "* A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs.\n",
    " This will be used to hire employees\n",
    "* Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Employee dataset provided comprises 1,200 rows and encompasses 28 columns, resulting in a dataset shape of 1,200x28. These 28 features are categorized into two groups: quantitative and qualitative. Among them, 19 features are quantitative, with 11 columns containing numeric data and 8 columns housing ordinal data. Additionally, there are 8 qualitative features. Notably, the \"EmpNumber\" feature contains alphanumeric data with distinct values but does not significantly influence the performance rating prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insights into the data, we have conducted correlation analysis, which examines the relationships between the features and the performance rating. Correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of linear association between two variables. Our analysis process involved Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis, as well as department-specific analyses, all aimed at achieving the project's objectives."

    "\n",
    "The dataset is composed of both categorical and numerical data. The target variable in this dataset is in the form of ordinal data, indicating that this problem is best suited for a classification approach. In the course of this project, we employed several machine learning models, including the Support Vector Classifier, the Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Bernoulli, K-Nearest Neighbor and the Artificial Neural Network, specifically the Multilayer Perceptron. Among these models, the Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron) stands out by achieving the highest accuracy, which amounts to an impressive 95.80%."

    "One of the project's key objectives is to identify the pivotal factors influencing performance ratings. To pinpoint these crucial features, we harnessed machine learning's feature importance technique. A central component of our data preprocessing strategy involved implementing Manual and Frequency encoding methods. These methods were utilized to transform string-based categorical data into numerical data. This conversion is essential as most machine learning methods rely on numerical input, making it necessary to convert string data into a numerical format.\n",
